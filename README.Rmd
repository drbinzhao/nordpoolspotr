## Introduction

Not much.. Just a single function package that wraps the NordPool Spot API. 

The package is just a pet project and in early beta. Changes can happen and I'm also very open for suggestions. The project was inspired by the [Python](https://github.com/kipe/nordpool) library.

Check out how it works below...

### Known Issues

* The function doesn't work when DST start or end.

```
# This won't work

# DST ends
np_prices("hourly", "EUR", as.Date("2016-10-30"))

# DST starts
np_prices("hourly", "EUR", as.Date("2017-03-26"))

```

## Installation

Install the package using Hadley's devtools package.

```

devtools::install_github("krose/nordpoolspotr")

```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how to use the function. All date values are returned with the timezone CET (as they are from the API).

```{r, examples}

# Load the package.
library(nordpoolspotr)

# Get the prices for tommorow (if they are published).
np_prices("hourly", "EUR")

# Get the prices for today
np_prices("hourly", "EUR", Sys.Date())

# Get a long data frame
np_prices("hourly", "EUR", long_data = TRUE)

# Get only the Danish prices in DKK
np_prices(time_unit = "hourly", currency = "DKK", areas = c("DK1", "DK2"))

```
